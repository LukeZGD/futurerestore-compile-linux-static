# futurerestore-compile-linux-static

- Compiles a "static" build of futurerestore for Linux
- By "static", I only mean libzip, libimobiledevice libs (libplist, libusbmuxd, libimobiledevice), and tihmstar libs (libgeneral, libfragmentzip, img4tool) needed by futurerestore
- Got a lot of the stuff needed from opa334's Windows compile script, thanks to opa334 for the script
- Script is tested on Xubuntu 20.04.2
